# TroupeX CI/CD Deployment Automation Summary

I've created a complete CI/CD pipeline for TroupeX that enables one-click deployment with GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Tunnels. Here's what's been set up:

## üìÅ Created Files

### Scripts
1. **`scripts/extract-production-config.sh`** - Safely extracts and documents production configuration
2. **`scripts/setup-digitalocean-droplet.sh`** - Automated DigitalOcean server setup with all dependencies
3. **`scripts/one-click-deploy.sh`** - Complete one-click deployment script for new or existing infrastructure

### Documentation
1. **`docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive guide for setting up GitHub secrets
2. **`docs/ONE_CLICK_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment documentation with troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions
1. **`.github/workflows/deploy-with-tunnel.yml`** - Enhanced deployment workflow with Cloudflare tunnel integration

## üîë Key Features

### Environment Management
- Automated extraction of current production configuration
- Template generation for all required environment variables
- Secure handling of secrets without exposing them

### Infrastructure Automation
- Complete DigitalOcean droplet setup with one command
- Automatic installation of Docker, Cloudflare, and all dependencies
- Security hardening with firewall and fail2ban

### Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow with build and deploy stages
- Automatic Cloudflare tunnel configuration
- Health checks and automatic rollback on failure
- Deployment notifications (optional Slack integration)

### One-Click Deployment
- Single command to create new infrastructure and deploy
- Support for both new and existing servers
- Interactive configuration wizard
- Automatic secret generation helpers

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Extract Current Configuration
```bash
cd TroupeX
./scripts/extract-production-config.sh
# This creates templates in ./deployment-config/
```

### Set Up GitHub Secrets
Follow the guide in `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` to add all required secrets to your GitHub repository.

### Deploy with GitHub Actions
```bash
# Push to main branch for automatic deployment
git push origin main

# Or trigger manually
gh workflow run deploy-with-tunnel.yml
```

### One-Click Deployment
```bash
# New infrastructure
./scripts/one-click-deploy.sh --new-droplet

# Existing server
./scripts/one-click-deploy.sh --existing
```

## üìã Required Secrets Summary

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `PRODUCTION_ENV` | Base64 encoded .env.production |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Server SSH access |
| `KNOWN_HOSTS` | SSH host verification |
| `DROPLET_IP` | Target server IP |
| `DROPLET_USER` | SSH username (usually 'deploy') |
| `SITE_URL` | Your domain (https://...) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | Tunnel credentials |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_CONFIG` | Tunnel configuration |

## üîÑ Deployment Flow

1. **Build Phase**: Docker images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
2. **Deploy Phase**: Images pulled, migrations run, services started
3. **Tunnel Setup**: Cloudflare tunnel configured and started as systemd service
4. **Verification**: Health checks ensure services are running
5. **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure with previous backup

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets (never in code)
- SSH key authentication only
- Automated firewall configuration
- Fail2ban for brute force protection
- Encrypted backups
- Automatic security updates

## üîß Maintenance

The deployment includes:
- Daily automated backups
- Log rotation
- Docker image cleanup
- Monitoring scripts
- Health check endpoints

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Run the extraction script** on your current production server
2. **Add all secrets** to GitHub following the documentation
3. **Test deployment** to a staging environment first
4. **Set up monitoring** and alerts for production
5. **Configure backup retention** policies

All scripts include help documentation - run with `--help` for usage information.
